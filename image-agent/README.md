## Development

Edit your agent logic in `app/agent.py` and test with `make playground` - it auto-reloads on save.
See the [development guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/development-guide) for the full workflow.

## Deployment

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
make deploy
```

To add CI/CD and Terraform, run `uvx agent-starter-pack enhance`.
To set up your production infrastructure, run `uvx agent-starter-pack setup-cicd`.
See the [deployment guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/deployment) for details.

### Alternative Deployment (Manual)

You can also deploy using the Python script directly, which is useful for testing or simple deployments:

```bash
# Create and deploy the agent
uv run python deployment/deploy.py --create

# List deployed agents
uv run python deployment/deploy.py --list
```

## Observability

Built-in telemetry exports to Cloud Trace, BigQuery, and Cloud Logging.
See the [observability guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/observability) for queries and dashboards.
